My gratitude for inspecting this application Champion!  

This APP will allow you to add your character to the main page.

When your character is added, click / tap on them to open up their loadout page.

 Once in the loadout page: you can assign the name of any new equipment you aquire throughout your adventures into these slots by clicking on one of the slot numbers.

Don't worry if you spell the name of that old god speech equipment wrong! You can tap the name again and change it if needed.

Should any of your characters meet an untimely end *Or you made a type* You can delete the characters as well. 

Hopefully this will help you keep track of what equipment you have gathered champion. No go and finish the rest!
